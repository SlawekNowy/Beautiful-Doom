GENERAL INFORMATION

Beautiful Doom is an all-encompassing total enhancement mod for GZDoom, aimed at making Doom feel, look and sound better, while keeping the original balance and gameplay intact (or tweaking it with some of the available options). Smoother animations, some improved sprites, particle effects, physics-based gibbing, as well as high compatibility with other mods—those are some of the features.

USE OF RESOURCES AND PERMISSIONS

If you want to use any of my resources, you have to contact me first and ask for permission. Reach me:

You may NOT use any of Beautiful Doom assets without my explicit approval. I do not guarantee a permission will always be granted. Permissions may vary for different resources, since some of these are 100% original, others are edits, and some come from other people. If a permission is granted, you'll need to credit me and all other people involved in the creation of a specific resource.

Before asking if you can borrow an asset for your own project, make sure your work adheres to the following requirements:
- It's not and will never be commercial in any way
- It's not affiliated in any way with projects or authors that are unwelcome in the Doom community (there are several, and you probably know who they are)
- It's not a low-effort repack/rehash/edit of other people's works
- The resource you want to use is already available in one of the stable RELEASE versions of Beautiful Doom (if it's only on GitHub, it's not free to use)
